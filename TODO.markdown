TODO
----

- avoid looping through messages already processed (i.e. resume support)
- create a simple interface with pyqt like an album frame (QFileSystemWatcher?)
- CLI options for host, username, password, folder, criteria and attachment size
- is_multipart() seems better if attachment is too big/inline (it crashes)
- better (real) debug logging :-)
