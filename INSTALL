INSTALL
-------

To install or upgrade IMAPClient (main dependency) via PyPI use pip:

```
pip install imapclient 
pip install --upgrade imapclient
```

Or using  EasyInstall:

```
easy_install IMAPClient
easy_install --upgrade IMAPClient
```

Your Python installation is supposed to have the ```email``` module by the way. Tests have been done using Python 2.7.3rc2.
